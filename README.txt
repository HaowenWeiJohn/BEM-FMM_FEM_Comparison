BEM-FMM and FEM Comparison

This code uses the BEM-FMM Engine to solve and time the Forward Problem of Biomagnetism in a 4-layer sphere head model for a given set of dipoles and electrodes.
The same setting can be solved with other approaches, e.g. Finite Element Methods, in order to compare.

Additional data, e.g. a mesh of the sphere model, is needed to actually run the code and generate results.

Take a look at "test_all.m" in the subfolder "tests". This script will give an idea of what is happening and in which order the functions should be used.
